# OE_project_1
Implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve an optimization problem (maximization and minimization of a multivariable function). The implementation allows selecting any number of variables in the configuration (i.e., the ability to test the algorithm for functions with, for example, 5, 10, 20, or 27 variables).
